# CLI-TYPESETTER

## README

The "cli-typesetter" is a project that helps typesetting a TeX file/project less pain.
Initially, user just needs to create a typesetting config file containning all desired preferences.
From later tasks such as typesetting or viewing resulted pdf file, user just runs only a simple
command.
